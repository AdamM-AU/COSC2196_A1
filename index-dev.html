									<p class="mb-0 lead">What is my your interest in I.T? When did your interest start?</p>
									<p>My interested in IT started when I was a young child, IT has endless possibilities only limited by the imagination and ability of the individual, 
									It provides seamless access to information from around the world and provides the ability to connect with other like-minded individuals not limited by distance or borders.</p>
									
									<p class="mb-0 lead">Was there a particular even or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any)</p>
									<p>My Farther started my interest in I.T, when I was a young child he was a computer programmer though out my childhood he 
									taught me a great deal about computers ranging from repairing them, building them though to programming.</p>
									<p>I remember all though my primary school days all I wanted to be when I grew up was a Computer Programmer like my dad, turning my own ideas and the idea’s of others in to reality, 
									I really put effort in to learning programming languages when I started high school the first real language I learnt was C, 
									followed by LPC I don’t count HTML or JavaScript with icons following the users mouse at this stage as programming.</p>
									<p>In my spare time in high school I enjoyed Playing LPMuds with people all over the world which some I still call friends, I also started writing my own LPMud during my high school days.</p>
									
									<p class="mb-0 lead">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</p>
									<p>I didnt choose RMIT for my online course, It was choosen for me by Open Universities, based on my start time prefrerences. If I had a choice; I would have been happy with any of the leading Australian Universities</p>
									
									<p class="mb-0 lead">What do you expect to learn during your studies?</p>
									<p>I expect to to validate my existing skill set by completing this course. I do hope to pick up some new skill's or abilitys as well.</p>

									<p>Besides from being obsessed with computers and electronics, I enjoy being outside as much as possible and enjoy 
									visiting new walking and hiking trails as much as possible with my two kids, I try do this at least once a month when possible.</p>
									
									<p>When I am not out and about, I am always looking for a new project to do at home which can honestly 									
									be anything from building a cubbyhouse to upcycling old electronics into something new, Normally something for the kids to enjoy.</p>
									
									<p>Failing that, I love sci-fi and fantasy movies and television shows and just relaxing at home.</p>
									
									<p class="mb-0"><strong>Pet-Peeves:</strong> People who think everything should be a "cloud" service or moved to the "cloud". 
									As honestly "cloud" is just a new buzz word for hosting your stuff on someone else's equipment and is 
									essentially a public bathroom with see though windows.</p>

									<div class="subheading mb-3">Position Description</div>
									<p>A <strong>Backend Developer</strong> is simple terms is a lot like a builder they build a house from the foundation to the structure (framework), 
									they would then hand off to the <strong> Frontend Developer</strong> or in the case of a builder an Interior Designer who’s focus is on the customer 
									facing aspects of the development or in other words what people are going to see.</p>
									
									<p>I find the role of a <strong>Backend Developer</strong> appealing as its more orientated to the work I find most appealing and interesting, 
									however I am also comfortable with <strong>Frontend Development</strong> as the two roles do require quite a bit of crossover, 
									the roles can also be combined into a single role which is called <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> but again even though 
									I have a lot of the skills required to be a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>,
									I prefer the complexities of <strong>Backend Development</strong> work as to be perfectly honest we make the real magic happen.</p>
